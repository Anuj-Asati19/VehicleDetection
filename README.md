# ArticleErrorCorrection(N.L.P.)
Article error detection and correction comes under the grammatical error
detection and corrections in English composition.
It can be achieved using natural language processing and can be done in two
ways:
1. Using rule base
2. Using machine learning

Using incorrect grammar can lead to sentences being meaningless and the
message unclear, which in turn can lead to misinterpretation by a communication
partner. Using correct grammar makes listening and reading easier for others to
understand and can make the communication process more enjoyable. It is very
important that medical reports are able to be understood by all of the medical
professionals who will interact with those reports. Correct grammar can ensure
that the proper meaning is understood right away and the patient is properly
treated.
Press materials with article errors indicate ignorance or carelessness on the part
of the writer, which may cause journalists to question the accuracy of the
content. With the increasing influence of English on a global scale, a huge
breakthrough has been made in the task of detecting English grammatical errors.
Based on the rule-based approach, this paper designs a new method for detecting
article errors in English composition.
